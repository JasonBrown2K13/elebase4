## Known bugs

Slideshows do not loop. 

Slideshow pagination buttons do not align to the centre of the slideshow above on the desktop website, but align better on mobile devices.

The fixed menu at the bottom of the prototype can sometimes be slightly hidden (not enough to hinder the user experience, however) when using Google Chrome or Samsung Internet Browser on a Samsung Android device, such as the Galaxy S8 used to test this prototype. This issue was not present in Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge for Android. 

The page does not display correctly in any version of Internet Explorer due to the way that Siemma (a crtitical component of the Elebase framework) is rendered. Providing that the 'ie.js' and 'ie.html' files are present, Internet Explorer users will now be redirected to a page informing them that the browser is not compatible.
